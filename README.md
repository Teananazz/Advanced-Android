Running guide:

1. make sure you follow the read me at https://github.com/Teananazz/AdvancedPart2/tree/android for the server side.
2.  firebase will only work properly on phones with google play(didn't test it completely.)
3.  make sure tools -> fire base -> Cloud messaging is properly connected ( 1 and 2 should be checked marked)
